hello julian awesome website fans! I come to you with news of a massive update I have been working on!

I have now made the existing pages friendly for mobile and have added a custom julian navigation menu for mobile
devices!

unfortunately, the layout for tablets has not yet been optimized so please don't look at this website on there
LOL

in this update I have also added the
[terminal](/terminal)
where you can type in commands and some other Epic stuff!

thanks for reading and stay tuned for future awesome updates!!! :)
